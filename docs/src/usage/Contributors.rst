***********************

If you're willing to help, you can clone the up-to-date GitHub repo: https://github.com/PyMoDAQ/pymodaq_femto using git command line or
GitHub Desktop. I advise to create a dedicated conda environment for this and install PyMoDAQ-femto's package as a
developer:

* ``conda create -n dev_env``
* ``conda activate dev_env``
* ``cd`` to the location of the folder where you downloaded or cloned the repository.
* install the package as a developer using the command ``pip install -e .``.

Any change on the code will be *seen* by python interpreter. When ready, you can ask to push your code into the main
development branch. A simpler way is to raise *Issues* on PyMoDAQ-femto's github page.
